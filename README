This pod contains the Fast and Robust Scan Matching library developed by Abraham Bachrach.
See the LICENSE file for licensing information.

The build system uses the PODs framework... for more info see:

libfrsm should have no external dependancies (lcm and libbot2 are optional, and used for visualization only).

The scan-matcher application depends on:
- lcm        https://code.google.com/p/lcm/
- libbot2    https://code.google.com/p/libbot/


If Intel's IPP libraries are available/installed, they will be used and provide a ~2X speedup. I have only tested with version 6
